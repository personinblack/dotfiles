# my personal dotfiles

here is me, managing my dotfiles and sharing them with random people
on the internet. these are what i use:

- *aurafetch* for l33t looking screenshots
- *bat* as fancy cat replacement
- *chruby* as ruby versions manager
- *ckb-next* to manage corsair keyboard
- *copyq* for clipboard management
- *discord* and *tiny (irc)* for chatting with friends
- *dunst* for displaying notifications
- *dwm* as window manager with *dmenu* as launcher
- *exa* as an ls replacement
- *farge* when I need rgb color code of something on screen
- *feh* for viewing images and setting wallpaper
- *firefox* as web browser
- *fish* as shell with *starship* prompt.
- *neovim* as text editor and IDE
- *picom* as compositor mainly for transparency
- *scrot* && *imgur.sh* with ImageMagick's *import* for screenshots
- *st* as terminal emulator
- *thefuck* for when i fuck up
- *tmux* as terminal multiplexer with tmux plugin manager (tpm)
- *xinit* for starting X sessions

*scientifica* is my font of choice for everything except most GUI apps. I keep
a todo.txt file and use it as my terminal greeter.

## installation

- install *stow* if you don't have it.
- clone this repository to your *home directory*.
- cd inside *~/dotfiles*.
- use `stow [foldername]` to install a config. this will symlink files to their respective locations.
