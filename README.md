# my personal dotfiles

here is me, managing my dotfiles and sharing them with random people
on the internet. these are what i use:

- *stow* for managing this
- *xinit* for starting X sessions
- *dwm* as window manager with *dmenu* as launcher
- *st* as terminal emulator
- *firefox* as web browser
- *dunst* for displaying notifications
- *picom* as compositor
- *tmux* as terminal multiplexer with tmux plugin manager (tpm)
- *fish* as shell with *hydro* prompt.
- *neovim* as text editor and IDE
- *exa* as ls replacement
- *bat* as fancy cat replacement
- *z* for quickly navigating around in shell
- *copyq* for clipboard management
- *feh* for viewing images and setting wallpaper
- *catgirl* as IRC client
- *farge* when I need rgb color code of something on screen
- *scrot* && *imgur.sh* with ImageMagick's *import* for screenshots
- *spicetify* for modding Spotify

*Victor Mono* is my font of choice. white on black is my goto colorscheme. and
i rarely update this readme so it may not be correct.

## installation

- install *stow* if you don't have it.
- clone this repository to your *home directory*.
- cd inside *~/dotfiles*.
- use `stow [foldername]` to install a config. this will symlink files to their respective locations.
